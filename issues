originally the set_player_to_go_first method was public and
tested but now it's private so really shouldn't be tested. Might
be better to just test that current player is set to the player
that is white before any moves have been made.

We now have the input parser ready in order to be able to
get the co-ordinates from the board. We now need a way to be
able to use those co_ordinates to check the move is legal.

Process for making a move
1) Check the square selected contains a piece
2) Check the move is legal within the parameters of
the movements the piece can make
3) Make sure the path isn't blocked by another piece
4) Check the move doesn't leave the player in check

For the movement the piece can make who should know?
The board shouldn't know...
So is it the Game that should know if a piece can move
forwards or should the piece itself hold that knowledge?
